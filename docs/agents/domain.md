# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, or
- `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root if it exists.
- `docs/adr/`: read ADRs that touch the area being changed.

If these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not suggest creating them upfront. The domain-modeling skill creates them lazily when domain terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If the concept is not in the glossary, note the gap for domain modeling.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
